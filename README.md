Parva
=====

Parva is designed to be a small, simple CLI based password manager with a strict set of security objectives:

- A strict password policy enforcing long, complicated passwords that automatically expire and renew;
- Automatically generated passwords based on the policy - the user cannot define their own passwords, thus enforcing the policy, preventing insecure or undesirable passwords;
- No caching or adding passwords to the clipboard. These concepts can be abused and are simply another attack vector for malware, viruses, etc.

I believe that Parva, combined with a small degree of discipline, will help the more security focused amongst us manage their passwords in a more secure, compact and portable manner without needlessly compromising security in the name of "convenience."
